## SITUATION
In October 2021, a week after my bootcamp began, I was tasked with writing an interactive game utilizing Javascript
and the Canvas API.

## INFORMATION
- At this point, I had been exposed to the fundamental primitives and control flow techniques in Javascript. The challenge
at this time would be to expand my intuition of "Object thinking" and Event Driven programming.
- A fellow peer of mine had been obsessively playing the game 'OSU' which is a point-and-click rhythm game that requires
  incredible hand-eye coordination. This seemed like something I could attempt to make, where features were discrete
  enough to be analyzed.

## ANALYSIS
- Determined that a game-style that already had precedence would provide a better metric of my progress. I could
  spend more time iterating inistead of ideating.
- Estimated that I would struggle with asynchronous functions/events, collision detection math and particle effects.
